Datum[1] is a simple question answering[2] system. Natural language parsing and
generation is achieved through the use of templates. Fact retrieval and
inference is performed by a Datalog[3] implementation, which uses the
"execution of concurrent machines" approach as described in [4]. The fact and
rule databases are backed by JDO, so should be compatible with any database
system supported by a JDO implementation e.g. DataNucleus[5].

Datum depends on the following libraries:
- DataNucleus [5]
- ANTLR v3 [6]
- Apache Commons Lang [7]

See the INSTALL file for compilation and usage information.
